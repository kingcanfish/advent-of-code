My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. Each puzzle is released daily from December 1st through December 25th and can be solved using any programming language. The challenges are designed to be approachable for beginners while still providing a worthwhile challenge for experienced programmers.
